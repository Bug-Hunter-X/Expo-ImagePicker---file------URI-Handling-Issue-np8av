This error occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library and selecting a photo from the device's gallery.  The image URI returned by the ImagePicker is often prefixed with `file:///`.  However, Expo's Image component, or other libraries that rely on Expo's image loading mechanisms (like `expo-image-loader`), may not handle this URI correctly, leading to an image not displaying.  This is because Expo's image loading system might be optimized for its own caching or URI structure.  It might not directly support the `file:///` URI scheme from native file systems.
